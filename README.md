### Objectives: 

Understand the Dataset: Get to know the structure and intricacies of our heart health dataset.
Data Cleaning: Tackle missing values and outliers to ensure data integrity.
Visualize Patterns: Use stunning visualizations to reveal key trends and insights.
Hypothesis Generation: Formulate hypotheses for deeper analysis and future research.

### Dataset: 

Our dataset is a treasure trove of health metrics, including age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more. With 303 entries and 14 columns, it provides a comprehensive view of heart health indicators.

### Analysis: 
Embark on a multi-faceted analysis journey, including univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses. Discover relationships and patterns that can lead to better clinical insights and decision-making.
